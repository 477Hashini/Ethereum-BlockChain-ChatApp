## Problem Statement
###### Our goal was to make a decentralized chat app in an attempt to create a more secure way of chatting. Most current applications, such as WhatsApp, operate on a centralized platform and therefore are more likely to be compromised. This app will use Ethereum blockchain as a decentralized ecosystem (Hertig).
###### Specifically, we will be using smart contracts to generate public keys for the end-users for security. This will be only accessible by the correct user.

###### The major problem with nowadays chat infrastructure is the presence of chat app, having a cost for sending fake messages would reduce people from sending messages to people. This app with the help the Ropsten Test Network helps us do that.

###### One more problem we are trying to solve is the privacy of people, just by having your phone number anyone is able to contact you on any of the centralised chat systems, here we are able to solve this problem by using blockchain and having cost for the same.


## Where is the code?
###### The code is currently hidden, if you would like access to it please contact me on my ASU email, or any one of my teammates who helped me make this project.
